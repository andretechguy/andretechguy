“Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it’s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,” Myhren told Ad Age. “Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”

For more context, on Tuesday, May 7th, Apple releasedd their ultra-thin iPad Pro. And to showcasse all of it's possibilities Apple made the "Crush!" Ad,  that showed a lot of creative tools, like guitars, camera, and paints being compressed by the hydraulic press. At the and only one thing will be left: the new iPad Pro.
