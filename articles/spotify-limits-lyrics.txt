#subtitle: Spotify is testing "lyrics limit" for free users

Coming Soon!

Spotify is yet once again trying to make free users switch to Premium Subscription. This time by limiting the lyrics feature behind a paywall with a message saying "Enjoy Lyrics on Spotify Premium". Many people including me noticed the change and posted it on Twitter/X and Reddit.
#html: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spotify Update! You can no longer view lyrics without Spotify Premium!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spotify?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Spotify</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpotifyPremium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpotifyPremium</a> <a href="https://t.co/ROgduzf1Qe">pic.twitter.com/ROgduzf1Qe</a></p>&mdash; Basic Tech Guy (@BasicTechGuy) <a href="https://twitter.com/BasicTechGuy/status/1785438617894338887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Some people also reported that they got a "Monthly Limit" on lyrics:
#html: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spotify now reportedly has a monthly limit on lyrics if you donâ€™t have Spotify Premium. <br><br>Every time you view the lyrics of a song, it will count towards your limit. <a href="https://t.co/0j6bDurpt5">pic.twitter.com/0j6bDurpt5</a></p>&mdash; Pop Base (@PopBase) <a href="https://twitter.com/PopBase/status/1785770780816720236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While Spotify have been quiet on this, we know that Spotify had already done the same thing last fall, when they locked out some free users from using lyrics, but that time Spotify announced that they were just testing this change. This time we got no official announcement from Spotify regarding this, which means that this time it might actually be permanent.

What was the point of this, since you can still find lyrics online, sounds more like a question to Spotify. We'll keep you updated if anything changes!
